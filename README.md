*Here's our programming challenge if you'd rather try it first. We love applications with programming challenges*

Below are trips from our dash cam users in the SF Bay Area, each of which is a JSON file containing an array of coordinates and speed (m/s) sampled at once per second. Build a performant web app containing an interactive map visualizing the distribution of speeds among these trips. All trips should be simultaneously visible on the map.
